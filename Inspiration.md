# ASNGIASAGF Background story

Let me start by saying that the small story I'm about to tell is an adaptation of a personal experience I had .

>A while ago I was approached by a recruiter who found my profile and had made arrangements to go through an intake process in a company that I really had a connection to.
>The feedback came out negative, and it was difficult to understand and figure out what do. I did nothing about it and moved on. The feedback was something like this:
>
> 1. Candidate with very deep technical skills and great understanding of Java
> 2. We are looking for people that belong to a younger age group however
> 3. He is a nice guy though but that's not what we are looking for.
> 
> A few things need to be said here. Age discrimination is a terrible thing and I didn't think it would happen in IT.  If they were looking for people in a younger age group, why did they accept my application at all in the first place? The nice guy comment wasn't necessary at all.

This is the story behind this repo. If there is anything good that came out of this story is that from here I got the name I was looking for, for so long for this repo.
